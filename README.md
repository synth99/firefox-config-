# Firefox Advanced Configuration

This repository provides a customizable `user.js` file for Firefox, containing advanced preferences that can affect browser performance and privacy.  
**Note:** These settings reflect personal preferencesâ€”feel free to modify them to fit your needs.

## How to Use

1. Open Firefox.
2. Type `about:support` in the address bar and hit Enter.
3. Scroll down to the **Profile Folder** section and click **Open Directory**.
4. Copy the provided `user.js` file into this folder.
5. Restart Firefox. The settings will be applied automatically.

> **Note:** If you change settings in `about:config`, they may be overridden by `user.js` the next time Firefox starts. To make permanent changes, edit your `user.js` file directly.
